Hey, Ken

Given your board meeting, tomorrow, I wanted to update you on our Work Order web app, which should also work on a mobile device. Here’s the project link with technical documentation: https://github.com/objektwerks/work.order

And, here’s, the user documentation: https://github.com/objektwerks/work.order/blob/main/doc/readme.md also accessible from the above project page.

It’s a straight forward app, but with some subtle complexities given the roles of homeowner and service provider who coordinate work on shared work orders over time. Email notification to both parties is provided when a work order is opened, updated and closed.

A few annoying web user interface issues remain, but I’m on it. I’ve tested the app to the extent one person can without going insane. :)

This web app is licensed for anyone to use freely as they see fit. See bottom of project page for details.

Deploying it to a host provider will cost anywhere from $10 to $100 per month, depending on options selected. Must have requirements include: 1) a database; and 2) an email service. The email service might require using a second provider.

If you examine the cost of more robust HOA web/mobile applications, you’ll notice a sharp increase in cost, driven by member count. So Work Order is a super cheap alternative — especially if we replace GPS with a CPA and alter the bylaws and rules to be exclusionary and approval-form free. :)

Despite an increasingly angry HOA membership, I realize the board is most often indifferent to the community and common sense change. But at least Work Order gives you a concrete talking point should the opportunity avail itself. Good luck, mate. :)

Cheers, Mike :)
